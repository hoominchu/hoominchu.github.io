      <div class="detailText">
      I love watching movies, especially the ones with good background scores. Adventure, mystery, detective and Tom Hanks are my preferred genres.
      <p> Some of my favorite movies are The Shawshank Redemption, Saving Private Ryan, Funny games, Life of Pi and the Bourne series.

     I have been going on treks since a young age and I enjoy spending time in forests. Having the western ghats close to home was a big advantage. I do birdwatching, snake rescuing and wildlife <a href="https://www.facebook.com/hoominchu/photos_albums" title="Go to my photo album" target="new">photography</a>.

      <div class="heading">Gardening</div>
      <div class="detailText">
      This has been a recent addition to my interests. I feel like growing at least some part of what I eat myself. We have an organic forest-farm, <a href="http://sumansangam.org" title="Suman Sangam" target="new">Suman Sangam</a>, where I enjoy working in my free time.
      <p>I have also tried and failed in growing bonsais.</p>
